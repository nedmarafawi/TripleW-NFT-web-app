## 🔖 About The Project
<!-- You know those websites where people are making millions of dollars where users can come and "mint" an NFT? This is basically the project.
Your will let users connect their Ethereum wallet, and mint an NFT to their wallet so they actually own it. They'll even be able to re-sell the NFT on OpenSea. -->
