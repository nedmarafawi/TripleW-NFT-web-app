## 🔖 About The Project
TripleW #01 is an NFT project consisting of 50 randomly generated three-word combination. Each piece is a unique and really funny.<br>

You can find the code for the deployed Smart Contract <a href="https://github.com/nedmarafawi/TripleW-NFT-Smart-Contract">here</a>

## 🦄 What is an NFT?
An NFT is a "token" that a person can own that links to some piece of "data" (ex. a link to a piece of digital art, a video, an image, etc). The trick with NFTs is that each "token" has a unique identifier that lets the owner prove that it's one of a kind.

## 💻 Instructions
### Setup
1. Connect your Ethereum wallet
2. Choose "Rinkeby" network
3. Get some fake ETH for Rinkeby

## 💼 If you don't have a wallet
You can just install <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank">Metamask</a> for free. Without a wallet, you can't interact with this project!

## 💰 Need some fake money
In order to deploy to Rinkeby, you need fake ETH.<br>

Why? Because if you were deploying to the actual Ethereum mainnet, you'd use real money! So, testnets copies how mainnet works, only difference is no real money is involved.<br>

In order to get fake ETH, you have to ask the network for some. This fake ETH will only work on this specific testnet. You can grab some fake Ethereum for Rinkeby through a faucet.<br>

#### Here's a few faucets to choose from:
* <a href="https://faucet.rinkeby.io/">Official Rinkeby</a>
* <a href="https://ethily.io/rinkeby-faucet/">Ethily</a>
